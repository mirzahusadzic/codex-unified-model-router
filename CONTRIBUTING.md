# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve the router. It is deliberately small: a local compatibility layer that fits Codex's existing model picker and thread workflow. Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first; it lists where each kind of change belongs and the behaviors every change must preserve.

## Development

Node.js 20 or later is the only requirement; there are no dependencies to install and no build step.

```sh
node --test                                # all tests; offline, no credentials needed
bash -n platform/unix/*.sh                 # shell syntax
node scripts/render-openrouter-entries.mjs # after editing prompts/ or adding a catalog entry
```

The installed router is a separate copy under your Codex home directory. Run `node install.mjs` to try a change in Codex, and `node install.mjs --verify` afterward.

## Project layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `router/unified-router.mjs` | The router's entry: the local HTTP server, request handling, the recovery flow, and diagnostics. The installers copy it as `router.mjs`, with the modules below beside it. |
| `router/upstream.mjs` | Routes from model slugs, upstream headers, the shared request opener, error bodies, and the usage tap. |
| `router/adapt.mjs` | Request shaping for each upstream (history normalization, reasoning, structured output, caching) and the bounded recovery payload. |
| `router/web-search.mjs` | Router-run web search and the stream rewriter that runs it and normalizes tool arguments. |
| `router/sessions.mjs` | Per-session state: provider isolation sides, Claude routes, and Ultra Spark lead call IDs. |
| `router/config.mjs` | Router settings from `openrouter.env` and the environment, keys, logging, and private state writes. |
| `router/anthropic.mjs` | Claude on Anthropic's API: Responses-to-Messages request translation, the streamed-event translation back, and refusals that move Claude to OpenRouter. |
| `router/common.mjs` | Helpers shared by the router's modules and the health verifier, including the source revision. |
| `catalog/` | Router model entries for the Codex catalog (OpenRouter models and Claude), each with a license notice. |
| `prompts/` | Shared OpenRouter instructions and the Ultra Spark delegation policy. |
| `install.mjs` | Cross-platform entry point that runs the installer or verifier for the current OS. |
| `platform/` | Per-OS installers and verifiers in `unix/` and `windows/`, plus the Windows access-control helper; see the [platform index](platform/README.md). |
| `scripts/` | Verifiers, installer helpers, and development tools; see [Scripts](#scripts). |
| `tests/` | `node --test` suites, plus a Windows access-control test; see [Tests](#tests). |
| `docs/` | [Setup and configuration](docs/setup.md) and [services and troubleshooting](docs/operations.md). |

### Scripts

Scripts you run:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `node install.mjs [--verify]` | Install, or with `--verify` check, through the platform scripts below. `--help` lists every option and setting; keep it in step with [Installer settings](docs/setup.md#installer-settings), which a test enforces. |
| `platform/unix/verify-install.sh`, `platform/windows/verify-install.ps1` | Verify an installation: configuration, tokens, permissions, catalog prompts, router health, and the service. Pass `--no-service` (Windows: `-NoService`) after an install without a service. |
| `scripts/render-openrouter-entries.mjs` | Render the maintained prompts into the checked-in catalog entries. Run it after editing `prompts/` or adding an entry. |
| `scripts/chatgpt-plan.mjs <codex-home>` | Print `active`, `inactive`, or `unknown` for the ChatGPT plan in Codex's login, as the installer's `CODEX_ROUTER_NATIVE_MODELS=auto` check sees it. |

Helpers the installers and verifiers call:

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/build-catalog.mjs` | Build `models.json` from Codex's bundled models and `catalog/`, applying prompts, hiding native models on request, and rejecting duplicate or colliding slugs. |
| `scripts/merge-config.mjs` | Merge the managed settings into `config.toml` and the OpenRouter-only profile, preserving everything else. |
| `scripts/prepare-credentials.mjs` | Write `unified-router/openrouter.env`, keeping the local token and any extra router settings. |
| `scripts/config-managed.mjs` | Report through its exit status whether a configuration already has the managed marker, which decides whether the installer asks before merging into it. |
| `scripts/verify-credentials.mjs` | Check the managed blocks, local tokens, and private permissions. |
| `scripts/verify-health.mjs` | Check the running router's health, capabilities, and source revision. |
| `scripts/codex-daemon.mjs [--verify] <codex-home>` | Restart Codex's app-server daemon after an installation and pin it to the CLI's Codex, or with `--verify`, check that it follows the CLI. Both installers and verifiers use it. |
| `scripts/verify-catalog.mjs [--report] <models.json>` | Check that a generated or installed catalog carries every router entry with the repository's context limits and prompts, or with `--report`, print what `/model` lists. Both installers and verifiers use it. |
| `platform/windows/private-path.ps1` | On Windows, restrict a file or directory to the current user. |

Shared modules: `scripts/openrouter-prompts.mjs` holds the prompt rules for OpenRouter entries, and `scripts/toml-lines.mjs` reads TOML line by line without mistaking strings or comments for keys, tables, or markers.

### Tests

`node --test` runs every `.test.mjs` file on macOS, Linux, and Windows; [CI](.github/workflows/ci.yml) covers all three. The tests use synthetic upstreams and need no credentials or network. `tests/prompt-budget.test.mjs` also needs the tested Codex CLI and skips without it, as in CI.

| Test file | Covers | Platforms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/unified-router.test.mjs` | Routing, history repair, reasoning and structured-output adaptation, OpenRouter recovery, provider isolation, endpoint preferences, header allowlists, streaming, web search, Claude's Messages translation and route fallback, and logs. | All |
| `tests/credentials.test.mjs` | Credential files and configuration merging: tokens, managed apps, analytics, and agent settings, and TOML strings and comments. | All |
| `tests/catalog.test.mjs` | Catalog entries, rendered prompts and the Codex tools they must not mention, prompt suffixes, catalog-build validation, and `verify-catalog.mjs`. | All |
| `tests/native-models.test.mjs` | ChatGPT plan detection and hiding native models. | All |
| `tests/install.test.mjs` | End-to-end installs without a service through `install.mjs` and the platform scripts, collision guards, key sources, setting validation, the closing summary and verifier report, the help text and argument errors, the daemon restart and pin step, and that the Unix scripts need no `jq`. Runs `platform/unix/install.sh` on macOS and Linux and `platform/windows/install.ps1` on Windows. | All, per-platform installer |
| `tests/log-level.test.mjs` | Router startup settings: log levels, endpoint preferences, and a corrupt isolation record. | All |
| `tests/verify-health.test.mjs` | The health verifier's capability, revision, and redirect checks. | All |
| `tests/prompt-budget.test.mjs` | What the installed Codex sends router models under the installer's configuration, through a local fake upstream: the tool list, request and tool-definition sizes, the features it turns on, and that apps and guardian stay off. Skips without the tested Codex CLI or reviewed expectations for the platform. | macOS (reviewed); others skip |
| `platform/windows/private-path.test.ps1` | Current-user-only access control lists on Windows. CI runs it in a separate step. | Windows |

## Making changes

- **Router behavior:** add a focused regression test in `tests/unified-router.test.mjs`.
- **New OpenRouter model:** copy `catalog/deepseek-model.json`, use `openrouter/<upstream-model-slug>`, and review every capability: context limits, reasoning levels, tool support, and prompts. A catalog entry alone does not prove compatibility, so try the model in Codex before proposing it.
- **Installers:** keep `platform/unix/install.sh` and `platform/windows/install.ps1` aligned, including backups and preservation of unrelated configuration.
- **Documentation:** keep the README brief and put details in `docs/`.
